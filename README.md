QT Library test with CMake
==========================

Dummy example to try to build a library with Qt and use it.

Purpose
-------

The goal is to create a simple example to see how we can create a shared library thanks to Qt, and use it in an executable.

In this repo, you have 3 folders under `source`
- `dummy_static`: it creates a static library that exposes one class `DummyStatic` (that doesn't make use of Qt)
- `dummy_lib`: it creates a shared library that is compiled and linked with `dummy_static`. It should expose `DummyStatic` and also `DummyLib`
- `dummy_app`: the applications that is linked to `dummy_lib` and uses the 2 exposed class `DummyStatic` and `DummyLib`

Build
-----

To build the project, follow these steps:

```bash
# create a build dir at the root of the repo
mkdir build && cd build
# run CMake
cmake -G "YOUR IDE" ../source
```
